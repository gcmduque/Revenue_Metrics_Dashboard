# Revenue Metrics Analysis and Dashboard

### Overview
<p align="justify"> Using revenue data from online games, revenue metrics (i.e. MMR, ARPPU, CHurned Revenue, etc.) are analyzed to identify the overall performance of the games through out the span of the available data. For analysis, both SQL and Tableau with its calculation feature were used to acquire the metrics. The final output is presented in a dashboard, comprised of multiple charts that all give key information that are vital for improving the overall revenue. </p>

### Steps
- Planning: Understand what the expected outcome should be and in what form should the data be in for it to be understood clearly.
- SQL: Process the data for analysis.
- Tableau: Load and Tranform the data in the form of a dashboard.
- Improvements: Apply changes in the dashboard that will help the audience in understanding the overall performance of the product (games)

### Conclusion
<p align="justify"> From these improvements, we can now get a quick picture of the overall result of the performance for the year. From a glimpse, we understood that our top performer is Game 3 which comprised the majority of the revenue and as well as the total users. Other than that, we can also identify other key points over the year such as when the revenue peaked (Oct) and when it started to decline (Nov). From the data we know that Game 3 has the most users while on the other hand, it can be seen that the main reason for the decline is the increase in churned users in both Nov and Dec. These observations are vital as it tells us that Game 3 should be the primary focus of the resources and should be maintained and improved to keep users onboard and maintain generating revenue. </p>
